					<h4>How to Build a Web Developer Portfolio for Free - Oct 22nd, 2020</h4>
				</a>
				<p>As I neared graduation from my Software Engineering Bootcamp, I realized that I needed to start doing everything I can to get my name out there to potential employers and start building my personal brand. I decided to not only build myself a portfolio website, but I also gave myself the challenge of building and hosting the site for FREE. This blog post explains how I did it, and I was even blessed enough to have it published by "Level Up Coding".</p>

					<h4>Hiding Your API Keys in Ruby - Sept 23rd, 2020</h4>
				</a>
				<p>We can find stories everywhere online where an API key was stolen, and all of a sudden the key owner
					is sent a huge bill for API calls that they never made. In this blog post, I explain how you can
					easily hide your API keys in Ruby and put the worry in the past.</p>

					Software Engineering program. BestByMe is a CLI application designed for users who do not have the
					time or interest to spend hours reading reviews and researching businesses. When a user enters a
					business type and a zip code, the app responds with the top ten most highly rated business of that
					type in their area. This project was built using vanilla Ruby and the Yelp API.
